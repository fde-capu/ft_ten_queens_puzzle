#### Have ten queens on a 100 squares board, none of them facing each other.

Swimming pools are fun. So is chess.

This program is able to show all possible positions of ten chess queens on a 10x10 board when none of them are confronting each other. It also counts the number of possible solutions, but I will not spoil that number, just run the code yourself.

This was a great challenge by the time it was written. It was fun to solve; I went to sleep thinking about it, woke up, and wrote in a single pass, so I was really happy with the outcome.

The output is as follows:

    $>./a.out | cat -e
    0257948136$
    0258693147$
    ...
    4605713829$
    4609582731$
    ...
    9742051863$
    $>

Sequence is read from left to right, meaning the correspondent position to the first queen on first column, and so forth.

It is primarly a (bare first) study on recursivity.
